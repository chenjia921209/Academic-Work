# Data Structures and Algorithms – Academic Work

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains my academic work for a university-level **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.  
All programs were implemented **independently each week**, following the course schedule.  

The central theme of the course projects is the design and implementation of a **HexBoard** data structure.  
Throughout the semester, I developed different components and extended features around this structure, focusing on both correctness and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Course Content and Programming Focus
Each week introduced new concepts, and I implemented a corresponding program.  
The major topics include:

- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** and encapsulation  
- **Linked structures and iterators**  
- **Trees and traversal algorithms**  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation**  
- **Custom iterators with fail-fast behavior**  
- **Cloning, subset views, and map-like interfaces**  
- **Invariant checking** to ensure correctness  

All programs are designed around the **HexBoard**, a hexagonal grid structure, serving as a practical case study to apply different data structure principles.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a specific week’s assignment.  
- Code files include only **my own implementations**.  
- Instructor-provided test cases and other copyrighted materials are **not included**.  

---

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of **Java data structures and algorithms**.  
- Gained experience in designing and validating **complex ADTs**.  
- Practiced systematic testing through integration with provided test suites.  
- Improved skills in **problem decomposition, abstraction, and modular design**.

## 📌 Note
This repository represents **only my original implementations**.  
Instructor-provided test cases and supporting files are excluded to respect copyright policies.
